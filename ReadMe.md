# Setup

## Data collection

1. Using this chrome extension, I recorded all of the Swile traffic to see my account operations: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/request-interceptor/nndjakbllljidligkiacmijcdlmooblb

2. After collecting the data, create a `requests.json` file in the `dist` directory. This will be the file your code reads the data from.
